    **Riskscoring execution**

        It would analyse the given app throwing an error only if the risk is greater than the given
        with the param -r. This operation can not being thrown simultaneously with standard execution.

        Usage example:

        .. code-block:: bash

            masappci -r float -a path/to/the/app.ipa (or apk) [-p packageNameOrigin] [-d]


    **Standard execution:**

        It would analyse the given app throwing an error if there are more vulnerabilities or behaviors
        than the given in the in the json file. This operation can not being thrown simultaneously with riskscoring execution.

        Usage example

         .. code-block:: bash

            masappci -s path/to/vulns_and_behaviors.json -a path/to/the/app.ipa (or apk) [-p packageNameOrigin] [-d]


    **Additional params**

        * PackageNameOrigin: The packageNameOrigin is an unequivocally value generated by mASAPP for identifying the
          applications. Giving this param you would help to the script to find your application in your user's
          scans if you don't use this param, the script would look into the user scans using the name of your
          .apk or .ipa file but sometimes it doesn't find because of a different interpretation of this field by mASAPP
          or an error generating this field. If the script doesn't find your app will show a list of all the scans that
          your user has, asking you to find your application and to execute it again using the param -p with the
          correct packageNameOrigin.

        * Detailed execution: If the user use this param, the following information will be shown after a successful
          execution:

            * A list of vulnerabilities, adding the tittle, risk, number of occurrences and the different occurrences
              with their evidences.

            * A list of behaviors, adding the tittle, number of occurrences, impact and the different occurrences
              with their evidences.

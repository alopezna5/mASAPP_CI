###### mASAPP CI

mASAPP CI is designed for being an easy automated security check in your mobile development cycle.
mASAPP CI is the combination of two tools:
 
 * [masappcli](docs/source/index.rst): CLI tool that upload and analyse your *.apk or *.ipa file looking for vulnerabilities and behaviors using 
 [mASAPP](https://www.elevenpaths.com/es/tecnologia/masapp/index.html) or 
 [mASAPP Online](https://www.elevenpaths.com/es/tecnologia/masapp-online/index.html).
 This tool will return an error if the analysis exceeds the ceiling previously set by you
    
 * [masappstage](masappstage/README.md): Groovy stage template that allows you to easy start using mASAPP CI in your jenkins 
 pipeline.
